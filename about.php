            <p>This Blog is for anyone who wants to learn or pick up a tip or two on restaurant operations. This wealth
                of knowledge was acquired throughout 50 years of blood, sweat, and tears. The managing experience we are
                looking to pass on has been gained by managing and working in a variety of venues. We are talking
                multi-concept all the way down to a small deli. We have not seen it all but we have seen a lot. </p>

            <p>These blogs are just some helpful advice on things that worked and things that blew up in our faces over
                the years. These are just suggestions based on our time in the business. That being said, every
                situation is different and nothing is written in stone. So take bits and pieces of our experiences and
                hopefully your life will be a little easier and you can learn something.</p>

            <p>Thank you for checking out the Blog and please feel free to give us some <a
                    href="contact.php">feedback</a> or ask for a topic to be covered in the blog. </p>
